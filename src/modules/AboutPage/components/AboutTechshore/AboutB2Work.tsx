            Founder Story
          </h1>
          <p className="zoom-in-element-founder">
            The inception of Novawork can be traced back to a coffee shop in San
            Francisco where Lance Eschliman, an innovative UX designer, met
            Fahim Arif, a tech wizard with a knack for decoding complex business
            challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            Both were individually making waves in their respective fields, but
            they felt something was missing. The digital landscape was evolving
            rapidly, but businesses were struggling to find comprehensive IT
            solutions that seamlessly integrated cutting-edge technology with a
            user-centric design approach. They saw startups grappling to find
            affordable yet specialized services and enterprises seeking
            out-of-the-box strategies to stay ahead of their competitors.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lance's passion for delivering stellar user experiences and Fahim's
            proficiency in the latest technologies sparked an idea: What if they
            joined forces to create a one-stop digital partner for businesses?
            The idea was ambitious, but their shared vision, complemented by
            their diverse expertise, became the bedrock for Novawork.
            <br />
            <br />
            Their journey from conceptualization to realization wasn't just
            about forming a company; it was about bridging the gap between
            technology and its users. They sought to empower businesses with
            solutions that didn't just work but resonated, engaged, and
            inspired.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thus, Novawork was born, embodying the duo's mission to
            revolutionize the IT sector.
