          <p>
            More than two decades ago, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius started a
            web design agency called the Rocket Science Group. Their focus was
            on big, corporate clients, but on the side, they created a
            delightful email marketing service for small businesses. Mailchimp
            was designed as an alternative to the oversized, expensive email
            software of the early 2000s. Founded in Atlanta in 2001, it offered
            small business owners access to many of the same digital marketing
            advantages that their much larger competitors enjoyed, powering
            their success and enabling them to grow. In the years that followed,
            Mailchimp continued to deliver results for budding entrepreneurs.
            But just as those original customers continued to grow, so did
            Mailchimp, evolving its product offerings to serve companies and
            marketing teams of all sizes and skill levels. In 2021, Mailchimp
            was acquired by Intuit, a company with a long track record of
            driving small business success and solving customer problems. Today,
            we continue to empower the underdog and strive to be the business
            partner we wish we had way back in the beginning.

          <h1 className="text-heading1-semibold mt-10 mb-5">Culture</h1>
          <p>
            Intuit Mailchimp strives to create a culture that empowers a humble,
            creative, and independent workforce. We are passionate about our
            small business customers and believe that collaboration and
            creativity are powerful tools to help them make their dreams a
            reality.
            <br />
            <br />
            We love how each new hire adds to our culture. And, weâ€™re hiring.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe that what makes us different makes us stronger. Building
            a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization is good for
            our teams, our customers, and our community. We empower each other
            to bring unique perspectives and experiences to work, and we
            continually seek new ways to do so.
